C - HELLO, WORLD

This project contains a series of C scripts that cover various basic concepts of the C language. Here are the tasks completed:

0-preprocessor: A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
1-compiler: A script that compiles a C file but does not link it.
2-assembler: A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.
3-name: A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named "cisfun".
4-puts.c: A C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" using the puts function.
5-printf.c: A C program that prints with proper grammar "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," using the printf function.
6-size.c: A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
Each script addresses a different concept and contributes to strengthening the understanding of the fundamentals of programming in C.
