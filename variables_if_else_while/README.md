C - Variables, if, else, while
This project focuses on introducing you to basic concepts in the C programming language, including variables, conditional statements (if, else), and loops (while). By completing the tasks in this project, you'll gain a fundamental understanding of how to work with variables, make decisions in your code, and implement repetitive tasks using loops.

Tasks
Positive anything is better than negative nothing

This program assigns a random number to a variable n each time it's executed. Your task is to print whether the number stored in n is positive, negative, or zero.
Refer to the provided source code for details.
Example output is provided for reference.
The last digit

This program assigns a random number to a variable n each time it's executed. Your task is to print the last digit of the number stored in n.
Refer to the provided source code for details.
Example output is provided for reference.
I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Constraints: Use only the putchar function, and all your code should be in the main function.
alphABET

Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line.
Constraints: Use only the putchar function, and all your code should be in the main function.
When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.
Constraints: Use only the putchar function, and all your code should be in the main function.
Numbers

Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
Constraints: All your code should be in the main function.
Numberz

Write a program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
Constraints: Use only the putchar function, you are not allowed to use any variable of type char, and all your code should be in the main function.
Smile in the mirror

Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
Constraints: Use only the putchar function, and all your code should be in the main function.

Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success

Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by ", ".
Constraints: Use only the putchar function, a maximum of four putchar calls are allowed in your code, and you are not allowed to use any variable of type char.
